    "# 1 AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive boosting or AdaBoost is one of the simplest boosting algorithms. Usually, decision trees are used for modelling. Multiple sequential models are created, each correcting the errors from the last model. AdaBoost assigns weights to the observations which are incorrectly predicted and the subsequent model works to predict these values correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the steps for performing the AdaBoost algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Initially, all observations in the dataset are given equal weights.\n",
    "    A model is built on a subset of data.\n",
    "    Using this model, predictions are made on the whole dataset.\n",
    "    Errors are calculated by comparing the predictions and actual values.\n",
    "    While creating the next model, higher weights are given to the data points which were predicted incorrectly.\n",
    "    Weights can be determined using the error value. For instance, higher the error more is the weight assigned to the observation.\n",
    "    This process is repeated until the error function does not change, or the maximum limit of the number of estimators is reached.\n",
